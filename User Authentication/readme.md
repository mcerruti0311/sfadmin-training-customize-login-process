## Secure Your Users' Identity
### When Can Users Be Prompted for Two-Factor Authentication?
Users can be prompted for two-factor authentication in various circumstances.
* Every time they log in to Salesforce, including API logins.
* When they access a connected app, dashboard, or report. This process is known as step-up or high-assurance authentication.
* During a custom login flow or within a custom app, for example, before reading a license agreement. More on this topic later in the trail.
